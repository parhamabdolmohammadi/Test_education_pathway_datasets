Footnotes:,,,,,,,,
1,"Age    'Age' refers to the age of a person (or subject) of interest at last birthday (or relative to a specified, well-defined reference date).",,,,,,,
2,"Highest certificate, diploma or degree  Highest certificate, diploma or degree is the classification used in the census to measure the broader concept of 'Educational attainment.'  This variable refers to the highest level of education that a person has successfully completed and is derived from the educational qualifications questions, which asked for all certificates, diplomas and degrees to be reported.  The general hierarchy used in deriving this variable (high school, trades, college, university) is loosely tied to the 'in-class' duration of the various types of education. At the detailed level, someone who has completed one type of certificate, diploma or degree will not necessarily have completed the credentials listed below it in the hierarchy. For example, a person with an apprenticeship or trades certificate or diploma may not have completed a high school certificate or diploma, nor does an individual with a 'master's degree' necessarily have a 'university certificate or diploma above bachelor level.' Although the hierarchy may not fit all programs perfectly, it gives a general measure of educational attainment.  This variable is reported for persons aged 15 years and over in private households.",,,,,,,
3,"Major field of study (based on the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) Canada 2021)  Field of study refers to the discipline or area of learning or training associated with a particular course or program of study.  This 'Major field of study' variable refers to the predominant discipline or area of learning or training of a person's highest completed postsecondary certificate, diploma or degree, classified according to the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) Canada 2021.  This variable can be used either independently or in conjunction with the 'Highest certificate, diploma or degree' variable. When the latter is used with 'Major field of study,' it should be noted that different fields of study will be more common for different types of postsecondary qualifications. At the detailed program level, some programs are only offered at certain levels of education.  There was an explicit instruction in the questionnaire which instructed respondents to be as specific as possible in indicating a subfield or subcategory of specialization within a broad discipline or area of training.  This variable is reported for persons aged 15 years and over in private households.",,,,,,,
4,"Occupation (based on the National Occupational Classification [NOC] 2021 Version 1.0)  Occupation refers to the kind of work performed in a job, a job being all the tasks carried out by a particular worker to complete his or her duties. An occupation is a set of jobs that are sufficiently similar in work performed.  Kind of work is described in terms of tasks, duties and responsibilities, often including factors such as materials processed or used, the industrial processes used, the equipment used, and the products or services provided. Occupations are generally homogeneous with respect to skill type and skill level.  Occupation applies to the contribution of labour to that part of economic activity that is within the production boundary defined for the System of National Accounts.",,,,,,,
5,"Gender  Gender refers to an individual's personal and social identity as a man, woman or non-binary person (a person who is not exclusively a man or a woman).   Gender includes the following concepts:   gender identity, which refers to the gender that a person feels internally and individually;   gender expression, which refers to the way a person presents their gender, regardless of their gender identity, through body language, aesthetic choices or accessories (e.g., clothes, hairstyle and makeup), which may have traditionally been associated with a specific gender.  A person's gender may differ from their sex at birth, and from what is indicated on their current identification or legal documents such as their birth certificate, passport or driver's licence. A person's gender may change over time.   Some people may not identify with a specific gender.",,,,,,,
6,"Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is sometimes necessary to protect the confidentiality of responses provided. In these cases, individuals in the category “non-binary persons” are distributed into the other two gender categories and are denoted by the “+” symbol.",,,,,,,
7,“Total” includes persons aged 15 and over. The categories for “15 to 24 years” and “65 years and over” are not displayed separately.,,,,,,,
8,"For information on data quality for this variable, refer to the Education Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2021, Catalogue no. 98-500-X2021013.",,,,,,,
9,"This variable shows the hierarchy of the 'alternative primary groupings' (a CIP variant) with detail on the two-digit series and the four-digit subseries. For more information on the CIP classification, see the Classification of Instructional Programs, Canada 2021: http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/concepts/classification. For information on classification and data quality for this variable, refer to the Education Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2021, Catalogue no. 98-500-X2021013.",,,,,,,
10,"This category includes men (and/or boys), as well as some non-binary persons.",,,,,,,
11,"This category includes women (and/or girls), as well as some non-binary persons.",,,,,,,
12,"Refers to the kind of work performed by persons aged 15 years and over as determined by their kind of work and the description of the main activities in their job. The occupation data are produced according to the National Occupational Classification [NOC] 2021 version 1.0.  Occupation codes are based on write-in descriptions of the respondents’ job title and main duties/responsibilities. Incomplete or vague write-in responses can reduce the accuracy of the codes assigned, particularly for the most detailed levels of the occupation classification. For example, when ‘sales’ is provided as a description of main duties or responsibilities, any one of the codes corresponding to sales associate, sales supervisor or sales manager could be assigned.  The potential for inaccuracy in occupation codes is elevated for smaller domains, when increased sampling variability also impacts the accuracy of estimates. In such situations, users are advised to consider using broader occupation categories.",,,,,,,
13,"Includes persons aged 15 years and over who never worked for pay or in self-employment, or last worked for pay or in self-employment prior to 2020.",,,,,,,
14,Includes persons aged 15 years and over who have worked at some point in time between January 2020 and May 2021.,,,,,,,
15,Census 2021 National Occupational Classification (NOC) code exception: The code and title of this category are not found in the NOC 2021; this category includes codes 00011-00015.,,,,,,,
